                                        Now and again all that we need is to escape from the terrible screaming sound of the urban areas and discover a dwelling place in the open country; somewhere like the beautiful Chikmagalur in Karnataka. 
                                        Regardless of whether you need to encounter the straightforward Malanad culture or simply need to lose all sense of direction in the hazy slopes of Mullayanagiri, the best homestays in Chikmagalur let you have everything. 
                                        In this little slope station, you can observe the captivating appeal of Western Ghats, see waterway Bhadra stream near your resort, and witness the far-reaching green fields transform into an uproar of hues and fragrances during sprout time.
                                        Here's a rundown of the best resorts in Sakleshpur for that serene get-away you've been hanging tight for.
